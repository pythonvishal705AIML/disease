A meta-model refers to a machine learning model that combines the outputs (predictions) of multiple base models to make final predictions. It sits on top of the base models in a model stacking or ensemble learning framework and learns to weigh or integrate their predictions optimally.

Key Characteristics of a Meta-Model
Purpose:

To combine the predictions of base models and improve the overall performance.
It captures patterns and errors that individual models may miss.
Input to Meta-Model:

The meta-model does not directly use raw input features (e.g., X_train or X_test).
Instead, it uses the predictions or transformed outputs from base models as its input features (also called meta-features).
Output:

The final predictions are the output of the meta-model.

Step 2: Create Meta-Model Input
The outputs from the base models are combined to create new "meta-features":
train_meta_features: A matrix combining predictions from DeepFM and LightGBM for the training set.
test_meta_features: A matrix combining predictions from DeepFM and LightGBM for the test set.

Train the Meta-Model
GradientBoostingRegressor is chosen as the meta-model:
It is trained using train_meta_features as input and the true labels (y_train) as the target variable.
This model learns how to combine the predictions from the base models to optimize performance.

Advantages of the Hybrid Approach
Enhanced Performance: The meta-model learns to combine the strengths of both base models.
Robustness: Reduces the likelihood of overfitting to a single model’s biases.
Scalability: Additional models can be incorporated into the meta-features in the future.

Summary of Data Flow
Raw Data (X_train, X_test) → Base Models → Predictions (train_pred_deepfm, train_pred_lgb, etc.).
Predictions → Stacked Together → Input to Meta-Model.
Meta-Model → Final Predictions → Evaluation and Saving.
